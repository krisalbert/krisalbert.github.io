*How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I had a really good experience creating a wireframe and HTML with my pair. It was useful to have two different inputs going into the design. I felt like at the end, we came up with a design that we were both really happy with. This was quite different from my initial expectation; I thought it was going to be difficult to do this in pair, and I would've been better off doing it on my own.

Pairing was very helpful because we were able to have immediate feedback about a lot of things, about whether doing it a certain way is a good idea, or if doing it another way is better. I also learned a lot doing this with a pair, little HTML tips and tricks that I might not have learned if I was doing it on my own.

*Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, it was great to have a blueprint of what you want to create. Having the design you want already laid out makes coding a lot easier cause you know what parts you need in your code. I've never done a wireframe before, and when I had made (very basic) websites in the past, I would sort of just wing the design while writing the code for it. Having a wireframe makes your life easier.

*What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We both had a pretty good idea of what we want the blog to look like, we didn't go into a deep discussion on what a "good" wireframe is, although maybe we should have. We did discuss whether what content should go in a particular section. For example, we discussed whether we wanted links to social media on the sidebar or in the footer. We visited some blogs to see what they did and saw examples of both, and we decided that we would prefer to put the links on our sidebar.

*What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
I actually didn't know what semantic elements were before the pairing session. My pair Ryan was talking about it at some point and sent me a link to to new semantic elements in HTML5 and also helped me understand it. The ones that I ended up using are <header>,<nav>,<article>,<section>, and <footer>.
