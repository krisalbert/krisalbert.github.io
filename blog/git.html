  <h1>My First Post!</h1>
  <h2>Version Control, Git and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>4 October 2015</h4>

      Welcome to my first blog post! Over the next several weeks, I will be writing on this blog to document my journey with Dev Bootcamp as I learn how to code and become a software developer. For my first blog post, I will reflect on the three questions below, which are related to what I learned during week 1 of phase 0 of DBC.

    <p>
      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
      <br>
Version control allows you to keep track of changes you made to files in your system, essentially creating snapshots of them in a given point in time. This allows you to work on files, create a snapshot, make another change, take a snapshot and so on. Another way of looking at this is using the "save as" function and creating multiple versions of a file manulally (ie, v.01, v.02, etc). Using a version control system like git is more efficient and less cumbersome than saving multiple copies of files with different versions and instead of creating multiple versions of your file manually, you can just have git deal with all that.
</p>
<p>
  There are many benefits of using version control, especially when working with a team. With version control, a team can be working on the same file all at once, and later on their changes can be merged. Version control also allows you to keep track of changes - you can see who made what particular change at a given point in time. It also allows you to roll back to an earlier version of the file if needed.
<p>
  <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
  <br>
  Git helps keep track of changes by allowing you to make branches. There is a master branch which contains a clean, working copy of the code. Developers will clone this master branch into their own which becomes their working tree. They can then make changes to their own branch and then later on submit a pull request where other members of the team can review the changes and then merge it to the master branch afterwards.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
<br>
GitHub is an excellent place to store your code. Because everything is online, it makes collaboration easier. There are millions of repositories available on GitHub for everybody to see, so it is also an excellen resource for anyone who codes.
